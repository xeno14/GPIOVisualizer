==============

Visualize GPIO state with matplotlib

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/xeno1991/GPIOVisualizer/image/image.png)

Each color indicates:

- Red: high
- Blue: low
- Gray: not a GPIO

## Usage

Place `RPi` into your working directory. Visualization starts automatically.

## ATTENTION

- When you run on Raspberry Pi, RPi directory in this repository should be removed.
- During running, matplotlib window looks freezing. **If you have an idea to fix it or of another way to visualize, please tell me**
