Workshop #2
===========

This month, we continue to feature the Raspberry Pi.
----------------------------------------------------

The theme will be Get Your Motor Runnin', and of course we'll connect some motors (DC and steppers) to the Raspberry Pi, and control them from Python. We'll explore more modules that help with hardware hacking, and we'll wrap it up with some interesting demo.
